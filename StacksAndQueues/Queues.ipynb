    "* FIFO approach: elements are added and removed from opposite ends\n",
    "* Practical tech application is any software that handles jobs on a first come first serve basis\n",
    "* Adding is called enqueue and deletion is called dequeue\n",
    "* One way to implement a queue is using a doubly linked list (access pointers to the head and tail)\n",
    "* There is also a data structure called a deque, short for double-ended queue, and pronounced \"deck\". In a deque, you can add or delete elements from both ends. A normal queue designates adding to one end and deleting to another end.\n",
    "* Most common use of a queue is for Breadth First Search (BFS)"
